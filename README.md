# ABOUT THE PROJECT

I was thinking about C++ language and I realized I don't have an experience about this language. (Without management-system) And then I thought about this project because I really don't know what is difference about operating systems. (About cross platform and OS special libraries) So I made a cross platform project. If you see an issue about this project please leave an issue to github.com/hanilr/file-explorer/issues

## Images
The project has been tested in windows OS. So I didn't test in linux or macOS. And I took images from windows OS.
